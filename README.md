##  Evaluating the Impact of ADS-B Data Cleaning on Algorithmic Processing

This repository contains the code, dataset samples, and experimental results for our study **“Evaluating the Impact of ADS-B Data Cleaning on Algorithmic Processing”**.
The core of this work is an **Autoencoder (AE)**-based framework used to evaluate how different data cleaning techniques influence downstream trajectory analysis and modeling performance.

###  Experimental Overview

* **Model Objective:**
  The Autoencoder minimizes reconstruction error to identify the most representative trajectories (baseline) and quantify how data cleaning affects algorithmic outcomes.

* **Evaluation Metric:**

  * Reconstruction Loss (MSE)
  * Error distribution analysis
  * Baseline selection comparison
